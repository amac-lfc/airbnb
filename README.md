# AirBNB

## Data Set

Inside Airbnb is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows its users to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world. The datasets found on InsideAirbnb contain many features such as the number of beds, number of guests allowed, description, number of reviews, location, and many more.

## Idea
Additionally, for more precise data Air DNA can be used. Unlike Inside Airbnb, AirDNA charges for its data. 
What to predict:
The price-range (category) to which a given listing belongs to (Economy, Mid-Range, Luxury) 
Price of a given apartment/house based on the numerous present factors in the dataset as well as on the proximity of venues and places 
Price in time of big events 
Price depending on the reviews 
Algorithms to use: Logistic Regression, 
Linear Regression, Linear Regression with Gradient Boosting method

## To-do list

* Step 1: Perform the necessary data cleaning and formating on the Chicago Airbnb dataset for future convenience. 
* Step 2: Develop (in a group) and implement a Logistic Regression algorithm for price classification 
* Step 3: By using the Foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com/) add to the existing data set the information about the proximate places and venues (like pubs, clubs, theaters, museums, metro, etc.).
* Step 4: Using the information from step 3, identify what category of places or venues impacts the price the most. 
*Step 5:Make a number of visualizations to get a better understanding of the data. (Primarily geo-visualizations)
* Step 6: Develop a model based on Linear Regression that predicts the price of a given house/apartment taking into account its location. 
* Step 7: Improve the model from step 6 with the help of the XGBoost Algorithm and perform some final tweaking of it. 
* Step 8: Retrieve the data about big events in Chicago and confront it with the historical price of Airbnbs. 
* Step 9: Develop a model that predicts the price of a listing given an event with a certain number of visitors.
