I also lived for a summer in Hong Kong and then London for a couple months, and then I settled in Chicago!  I've been here for over 14 years now and I love it!

I'm big into food and beverage.  I've been to most restaurants in Chicago at least once, and I'm always on the scene sampling the latest.  Typically, I travel outside of the country 4-5 times per year.  At this point, I've been to more than 60 countries and my favorites are mostly in Asia and Central/South America.

I love soccer, health and fitness, photography, skiing, hiking, biking, scuba diving.  Most nights, I'll be cooking up some food and enjoying some tea.

The place is just not big enough for more than 3 or 4 people to be in the unit.  Smoking is strictly prohibited in the unit, but guests can smoke on the balcony and there is a container for butts.

It feels more like a village than a neighborhood. If you walk south along the lake, you'll find a quiet and ethnically diverse working-class community. If you head southwest, towards the Jarvis El stop and beyond, you'll find the heart of Rogers Park -- a true hidden gem of this city. If you head west on Howard, you'll find an Afro-Caribbean community. As for places to go, the Lighthouse Tavern four blocks south is a wonderful neighborhood place. It's cash-only, but with a cash station inside.  The R Public House and Pointinstil are a bit more upscale and clustered around the Jarvis El stop. West on Howard, you've got a great Jamaican fast food place called Yamon, and four blocks past that you've got a great little brewpub called Peckish Pig. Half-way between them is our favorite place, Ethiopian Diamond 2.","The main thing to note is that, while this is a house, it's a townhouse governed by a homeowners' association. We have close, friendly neighbors who are are kindly LETTING US rent our place out for short periods. They don't have to do this, and we won't tolerate anyone who violates their trust by being a shitty neighbor.","For public transportation, you're a 40-second walk from the 147 Express bus and a five-minute walk from the Red, Purple, and Yellow lines of the El train system. The 147 takes you straight into the Loop, beginning at 4:30 am and running until 9:30 pm. It takes you out of the Loop until 10:30 pm. The El into and out of the Loop (the Red Line), by contrast, runs all night. The El into the suburbs (the Purple and Yellow lines) stop at a certain time.   The Red Line takes you to Wrigleyville (and Wrigley Field), Lakeview, Rush Street, the Loop, Comiskey Park, and beyond. The Purple takes you to Evanston. The Yellow takes you to Skokie. By car: you're a ten-second drive to Sheridan Road, which weaves through the North Shore if you head north and to Lake Shore Drive if you head south.  If you take the El back late at night, we recommend you get off at Jarvis instead of Howard. It's a wee bit closer, and it may be safer. (The Chicago Police Department reported 17 violent crimes at Howard last","You'll have exclusive use of the top floor, which is where the bedrooms are, and mostly exclusive use of the kitchen and dining areas (the exceptions being when one or both of us are in town, in which case you'll bump into us on the ground floor).

We also do have friends over a lot and we encourage you to do the same. If you're unclear on the social use of the common areas, we can pin that down before you book","You are responsible for taking out the garbage and keeping the back drain clear if you are occupying the whole place. The main rule is respect for neighbors: be quiet while on the sundeck: use only the LOWER deck, and keep the volume down. If you use common furniture, make sure to share with other residents.

But here I am, 20 something years later, running a fabulous Greek vacation rental business with historic homes & penthouses in Athens, planning Greek travel itineraries and leading small group food & wine focused tours around my adopted homeland and loving the life that I am lucky enough to be living. Of course I did pick up an equally crazy, workaholic Greek husband along the way, as well as a stray Greek animal or two!

Update: End of November 2017 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 15 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece ask us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so we're finally doing it - we've just completed the renovation of a fab old factory with 3 vacation rentals called the Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether we share an ouzo in Athens in our Acropolis View Alpha Plus penthouse or Sky Villa or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago, in our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed.

I travel for both business and pleasure (although predominantly business).

I have noticed that some folks are making reservations for others to stay in my apartment. For better communication and a good stay experience for everyone, bookings should be made directly by the people who will be staying in my home.","I’m a fan of the Metra. It’s a commuter train that gets you downtown quickly (15 minutes and only one stop in between) and drops you off in the West Loop at Ogilvie Transportation center, one of the main train stations in Chicago.  Second favorite is the 147 express bus, which takes you right down Lakeshore Drive to Michigan Avenue; no stops in between Foster and Delaware, just a smooth, 20-minute ride down LSD with  a stunning view of Lake Michigan and no Cubs foot traffic. To get to the 147, take the eastbound 92 Foster bus to Sheridan/Foster (after the Berwyn red line) and then transfer to the 147 at Sheridan/Foster. You can also ride the El if you need to get off between my apartment and downtown.

I am a devoted vegan who enjoys cooking. I have lived all my life in Chicago, and I attended Columbia College here where I got my BA in Film & Video. Now that I am a senior citizen and retired for the most part, I spend most of my leisure time photographing and gardening.

The front doors are locked at all times and access is granted with a key fob. We highly recommend keeping your key fob in a safe place, because if you lose it, you’ll lose access to the entire building. Not fun. It takes time to replace it, which means you might be locked out of the building and the apartment for a while, and any fob replacement will incur a fee of $300.

Or, take a spin on two wheels using one of Chicago’s bike-sharing programs, like Divvy.

Our space offers fellow travelers a little southern hospitality in the city we can't live without. Other things we can't live without - Dark Matter coffee, good wine, good friends (and the just okay ones, too), good beer, and laughing a lot from all of the above. 

We hope our own experiences have created the perfect space that ensures you have a wonderful local experience in a global city, if there's anything we can do to help, it's against our constitution not to try so just ask! 

When we're not traveling as much and as far as possible, a few other things we enjoy are live music (seriously, a LOT of live music and we met at a music festival), camping, golfing, reading (Tom Robbins is a fave), meeting new people and exploring one of the greatest foodie cities in the world (hope our guidebook helps!) If requested, we're more than happy to offer recommendations and advice that only locals could know.

5 things i can't live without: specialty coffee + coffee shops, spotify premium (i listen to music most of the day), city life, art/design and sunshine. also my family which is most important : )

food: i love to eat good food and try new places from foodie restaurants and gastro pubs, to food trucks. i also enjoy cooking.

favorite films: the royal tenenbaums (anything by wes anderson) lost in translation, the diving bell and the butterfly, breathless, annie hall, garden state...

my style of traveling is: checking out as many fun and unique things as possible. exploring neighborhoods, people watching and being in a highly walkable area are key. i also enjoy biking, outdoor markets, festivals, concerts, scuba + snorkeling, hiking, and family friendly places. oh, and did i mention coffee shops ; )

I am an artist and a contemporary ballet dancer with Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. I travel a lot for work, so I am always looking for good people to keep the energy flowing beautifully in my cozy home. I tour both nationally and internationally with the company.

I'm a huge fan of travel, so even when I'm not working, I'm off jet-setting somewhere. So far, I've traveled to 26 countries. Some of my favorite places are Taiwan, Indonesia, Nicaragua, France, Thailand, Singapore, Jourdan, Italy, Spain, and right here in Chicago. I just moved from New York, after having lived there for 10 years, so being back in Chicago is wonderful!  I love new experiences and exchanges and good, positive energy.

I'm very friendly, calm, artsy, and outgoing. I dance, make dances, make art, and teach. When I'm not doing that I'm cooking, reading, being in nature, out with friends, being poetic, living life!

My home is me. After traveling so much, I love to come home to something that centers me. My place is quiet, open, cozy, comforting, bright, and relaxing--the perfect place to recharge.

I am a considerate guest and will leave any room or apartment the way I found it.  I tend to travel light so that it's easy to move from place to place. I like to enjoy a city for a few days before going some place else.

We started At Home Inn Chicago in 2000 as a reservation service for bed and breakfasts in Chicago, and have since evolved into one of the city's most-respected sources for vacation rentals, corporate housing, and weekend getaways. 

We provide fully furnished vacation rentals and corporate housing throughout the city in or near Old Town and Lincoln Park.

We are here to answer all of your questions about Chicago, whether you need a restaurant recommendation, public transit tips, or insider tips on how to experience the Chicago that locals know and love. 

We love this city, especially getting ribs at Twin Anchors in Old Town before a show at Second City.  Topo Gigio is a great local Italian Restaurant and The Gemini Bistro is an excellent choice for fine dining. And Velvet Taco, casual with its own unique style on Lincoln is fabulous!

The free concerts at Pritzker Pavilion in Millenium Park can't be matched by any city in the world.

My name is William.

I am a self-employed artist living & directing a gallery in Wicker Park. Last year I completed a Masters degree in Fine Arts at the School Of The Art Institute of Chicago where I studied Video, Performance, Photography and Film.

Important things to me are dream recording, writing, correspondence art, experimental film, movement practices, reading & traveling. I try to travel as often as possible, even if it's just a driving trip of two hours to camp somewhere for a night or two.

I want to provide an environment for artists & other creative, passionate individuals to have a voice & present their work. Sharing stories, ideas, experiences & realities are what we're in it for. We at the gallery are holding the torch in the neighborhood to provide a space for what might be unsayable elsewhere. We are daily developing our intentional space here to create an inspiring atmosphere for all who step foot inside, whether it's for a project proposal or a short visit. It's an older building, lovingly-worn, rooms with character surrounding an open gallery space.

As an airbnb guest, you can expect that we'll be curious about you. Our roommates & us all get along really well: It is an easy going dynamic here at the house. We are an eclectic variety!

We are friendly people who enjoy meeting new friends and traveling. We have lived in the Caribbean, London, and New York before moving to Chicago. Came to Chicago primarily for school but then we loved it and decided to stay. Yes, we love Chicago, and even the winter is GREAT! Good food options are unbelievably amazing in Chicago.

I have multiple apartments on this website. Some of the apartments are  3 bedrooms, bathroom, living room, dining room, and kitchen. Some are two bedrooms, bathroom, living, and kitchen and the others are 1 bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. We provide additional airbeds if needed. The airbeds are extremely comfortable and are queen size and 18 inches high. 

All the apartments have free WiFi, guestbooks, and basic amenities such as TV, iron, iron board, refrigerator, hair dryer, with water, pop, and juice, microwave, coffee maker, cups, plates, pots, pans, bathroom towels, shower items, etc.

Airbnb is extremely fun for us since we are also international.  We have traveled to most of the states in the US, London, Milan,  Italy, Turkey. I have also attended Universities on both sides of the Atlantic (London and Chicago).

Weekly cleaning included. This is a super upgraded century old building. It has all wood floors throughout, a brand new modern kitchen, (complete with top of the line dishwasher, washer/dryer), a tankless water heater, and a brand new furnace. It's as deluxe as you will find. And because it's old and has hardwood floors it's important to be mindful of the sound of clomping feet! It is a walkup, one flight (no elevator). There is loads of sunlight and in the spring we just leave the windows open to let in cool air and the sounds of spring. At dusk you will be introduced to a cacophony of cicadas. So p",none,"Lovely, friendly, with kids and dogs and old people (and some new families too). It's not a trendy/hip neighborhood (just yet) so there is a lack of a huge amount of walking to restaurants and marketing shopping. However there are a few nice places that you can walk, and which I will recommend. There are loads of grocery stores about a mile away in every direction. We especially like the 24 hour hamburger stand (Suzie's) in the summer time, for shakes and grilled goodies. A Peruvian place is one block away. Kalbi is on Lawrence and is one of the best Korean BBQ in the US (and a dive). Trust me. A greasy spoon for breakfast is Golden Nugget. New to the hood is the amazing Old Irving Brewing brewpub which many guests frequent several times per week because it's so good and so close. Other stuff: I prefer Sarapino's or Lou Malnati's  for pizza, #1 Chop Suey for Chinese, and PotBelly for sandwiches. We have a couple Starbucks as well as two awesome independent coffee shops (Cafe Urbano and","You will have neighbors above (me!) and below (long term regular tenants). We have never had an issue. As long as you don't have a lot of guests partying all night, we will all get along perfectly.","Really easy actually. It's about a 10  minute walk, with luggage,  to the Blue Line which goes to the Loop in 25 min or outbound to O'Hare in about 20.  We can provide detailed instructions on how to get here from either airport using the L. You can park on the street if you are traveling by car. If you prefer to use taxis  from the airport you can do that in their taxi line. Once you are here, taxis and  Uber cars are available to pick you up within a few minutes. Most likely you will want to use the Blue Line to go into and out of the city, You can stop at any of the great urban neighborhoods on the way in (Irving Park, Logan Square,  Bucktown/Wicker Park at the North & Damen stop, for example). You can take the Blue Line straight in to Clark and Lake to transfer to Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink and Greeen lines, or on to the Jackson stop and walk three blocks over to Michigan Avenue and you will be at the Chicago Architecture Foundation about a block from the Art Institute. Buses and ",You can use the entire place.,"You can always call or text me. I am available for anything related to the apartment or the community. Just reach out. This is a self contained flat and you will have full access to it for your stay. I live in the building and am available if you want to chat about things to do, places to see, or how to get around.  Or you can be entirely on your own. You will find a guide to our favorite things to do and places to go inside the ""book"" box on the  coffee table and part of it is included in the neighobrhood description below.","We completely renovated the nearly 100 year old building in 2014. All new plumbing, water service, mechanicals, floors, new bath rooms with huge walk in shower and fully appointed kitchen with new appliances, Kuerig coffee maker (a wide selection of k coup coffee and tea bags), toaster (we provide the bread and muffins)  etc. So everything works.   Regarding our old building: You will hear the tenants downstairs moving around and they will hear you if you have the TV or music turned up or if you have loud voices or stomp around. Please moderate your sound, including your footsteps, so that we minimize disturbing the neighbors, especially after 10pm. We welcome families with children, however we do not rent to individuals or groups under the age of 21.   No drugs, no smoking.  If you smoke, there is a $500 cleaning fee. If you do drugs? We will ask you to leave.  Pets may be allowed if we discuss it beforehand.

That's my three youngest kids in the scooter sidecar with me. My oldest is all grown up and just graduated from law school in Texas. 
I worked for Apple. I currently consult with companies about technology/internet/social media/marketing/branding. We own the entire building and I work and live (some of the time) on the third floor with tenants on first floor. We use AirBnB for the Garden Apartment (totally private), the second floor is a hostel style AirBnB, and upstairs on the 3rd floor we have up to three bedrooms that are available most days and every other weekend (when my kids are not staying with me).
I enjoy going on bike rides to the beach with my kids, and my girlfriend and her kids. I love to read and I am a tech geek. I am a coffee OR tea drinker and after drinking both black for almost forty years, I have started using cream in them — a habit I picked up in Nairobi, Kenya a couple years ago when I was doing some missionary work (plus my girlfriend uses cream and so I have no choice). 
If I had to pick some things I can't live without: my girlfriend (and her boys); my kids; my technology; my morning coffee; my fellowship; and my friends. And I love to watch movies. Old. New. Comedy. Mystery. Action. It doesn't matter. I like them all. 
I enjoy working out — lifting weights and riding a bike, plus I am a life-long swimmer. I also just started playing hockey! At age 52! Crazy. 
We have been hosting guests for three years now. We have over 141 reviews. We are a SuperHost. We love this. And we are really good at it.
I am a pretty laid back guy. I like things to be neat and tidy, but it's hard to do without motivation. AirBnB has been the motivation to get our place all tricked out and we are very proud of it. We hope you will enjoy staying here. All of our units are in a great neighborhood—in a great city. We have lots of suggestions for fun stuff to do, not the typical touristy stuff, but cool Chicago things that Chicagoans like to do/see.

Born and raised in Chicago, we became avid travellers and barter enthusiasts. With over 20 years of travelling we could easily write our own book on travelling on a budget.  We PRIDE ourselves on the deals we obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.  We are geeked when we find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, our website for our guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.  It places you in parts of the world where you probably wouldn't have gone but always wanted to go to get that 'local' feel with a local and trusted host.   

Since we don't travel as much as I used to....Let your experience be our experience!

I was in the 26th year of a high paying but dissatisfying job that I was afraid to leave.  I was in the 25th year of a mutually unhappy relationship to which I felt some moral obligation to stay.  I had few friends. little energy and few interests outside of work.  In retrospect, I was depressed.  First, she found someone new.  Then, I was let go due to budget cuts.  Although that year was filled with uncertainty, all of the sudden I felt so much lighter.  My previously miserable existence was not brimming with opportunities (the opportunities had been there, I had just grown to not recognize them).  My mantra became a sort of ""why not"".  I gave up my car, most of my possessions. and moved to the home of a friend in Chicago.  I had a hobby rock and mineral shop located in The Chicago Mosaic School.  I started spending long hours there every day.  I started becoming helpful... cleaning up, organizing, locating materials, running errands.  Soon the school hired me on as their Operations Officer.  I started becoming sociable too...accepting and extending invitations to dinner, concerts, movies, evenings spent just hanging out.  Soon I had more friends than I'd known in the last 25 years.  Good friends.  The kind who will speak to your face the same way they speak of you when you are not present.  Now, thanks to one of those friends, I am in this fantastic apartment, close to The Chicago Mosaic School.  I'm back to doing the things I enjoy... listening to alternative music, rock and fossil collecting, camping, bird watching, gardening, and spending quality time with those friends.  Many of my guests are friends and artists who come to Chicago throughout the year in order to take classes at The Chicago Mosaic School.  I enjoy hosting them and spending entertaining evenings together. In a world made up of so much conflict and competition, I personally find it very encouraging to see people of different ages, genders, education, vocation and experience come together cooperatively under one roof and connect with one another for an evening or a few days.  I hope everyone who elects to stay here departs with a smile.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/76e1591a-735c-4dd9-9594-47ab8361116b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/76e1591a-735c-4dd9-9594-47ab8361116b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Edgewater,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']",t,t,"Chicago, IL, United States",Edgewater,Edgewater,,Chicago,IL,60660,Chicago,"Chicago, IL",US,United States,41.99462,-87.66425,t,Apartment,Private room,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Free street parking"",""Hot tub"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",""Extra pillows and blankets"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Garden or backyard"",""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Host greets you"",""Shower gel"",""Baking sheet"",""Trash can""}",,$65.00,,,$0.00,$0.00,1,$10.00,1,31,1,1,1125,1125,1.0,1125.0,7 weeks ago,t,26,54,80,348,2020-04-23,160,48,2017-02-19,2020-03-15,99.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,t,R17000014962,"{""Illinois State"","" Cook County"","" IL"","" CHICAGO""}",t,f,flexible,f,f,2,0,2,0,4.14

I see myself as part of the solution. I love it here because it is not crowded, and it is so close to downtown. I walk around at night, but I am sensible about it.

Garfield Park Conservatory is near, United Center, Humboldt Park, Ukrainian Village are about a mile or so away. There are great spots to eat all along Chicago Avenue, California and Division both have lots of neighborhood eateries and bars, funky boutiques.

Northward (toward Kedzie) 2 stops, it connects to CTA Bus Route 66 Chicago Ave bus and the 52 North California bus route. Very easy.  Uber and Lyft both come here happily, and I have a good relationship with the drivers that I get often.  There is a bike rental (Divvy) right by the California train stop, and one a block north of me at a green center.

I do much of my work at home;  in my studio.
 I spend as much time out on the porch as possible, doing writing and some stitching, tending flowers and a veggie garden out in the surrounding yards. I have my own little happy zone right here in the middle of a major metropolitan city, including friendly neighbors.
My little rat terrier Mayzee is my constant companion. 
Things I like to do...  Indie Films usually turn out to be my faves.  I go to some live theater, as well as help make it here in town. Books, got to have books always. And Bike Riding!.  I probably would love yoga if I would think to do it more Ha! 
Veggie food for me, sometimes I like to cook. Former foodie, did my time in the restaurant biz. 
If you would stay over here with me, you are welcome to make yourself at home.  Have your privacy or hang out, I leave it to you. My dog may like to have a cuddle, if you are up for that. You might want to hang by the electric fireplace heh, very mod, and toasty. I have lots of books to peruse for such an evening.
I know in traveling I look for the food of the people! I can tell you my spots or help you find what you might be looking for. Or bring take out, eat in the living room, or back porch if you like al fresco. 
But maybe you just want to  crash someplace tidy and less sterile than a hotel, that's cool. The building is old, maybe a hundred years? but it has all new plumbing and such, so I feel it is the best of both worlds. 
I don't know that I have a life motto, but I firmly believe in doing what makes me happy!
I look forward to meeting interesting people on their travels; feeds the brain!

We've enjoyed hosting many guests from all over the world, and we're always excited to share our wonderful city and neighborhood with new visitors.  We are honored to be considered a second home for many visiting family and friends in the neighborhood.

I've lived in the Wicker Park/Bucktown neighborhood over 15 years and have seen a lot of amazing changes.  There is always a new restaurant opening while old favorites just get better with time.

I grew up in Chicago and returned home in 1996 after earning an Urban Studies degree from Brown University.  I started running the Wicker Park Inn in 2004.  Over the years, we've updated and expanded the Wicker Park Inn which now includes four guestrooms and three apartments.  We are staffed with amazing innkeepers, Robin and Emily, and our impeccable cleaning staff.

We look forward to hosting your stay!

Welcome to your temporary home in Chicago!  We love our location near Hyde Park, the University of Chicago, the Lake and the Parks and just over 10 minutes to downtown Chicago via the Lake.  

Our family of four takes full advantage of the walking and bike trails in the area. We also frequent nearby Hyde Park, for its distinctive and unique offerings and to hopefully, run into a friend or two.

We still love road trips but, our favorite trips are with our extended family.  Recently, 20+ family members descended upon San Pedro, Belize and again in Costa Rica.  This year less exotic Washington, DC is on the list.

Because I have Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis I am an licensed Illinois Medical Cannabis patient.  I live a healthy lifestyle which includes living gluten-free and I encourage others to incorporate health into their lives.

The Spark Clubs is based on a wellness concept.   We do not allow tobacco because it is a known carcinogen and the chemicals affect the air quality of everyone in the building.  The smoke smell lays on the walls and soft goods, linens and curtains.  We have to spend extra money to clean that off when folks violate our rules. That is why we have a security deposit now to encourage good behavior.

When people use cannabis alone, there tends to be significantly less smell and it does not linger. With the ventilation methods we employ, any smoke can be quickly evacuated from the room.  As a result, our rooms stay fresh.  

As far as linens are concerned, we shopped for high-quality bedding to provide you with the best sleep experience you can find.  Our beds have toppers and pads and down comforters and feather pillows and percale sheets... all designed to make your sleep experience exceptional.  In order to maintain our investment in our linens, we ask that people refrain from smoking, eating or drinking in the bedrooms.  Each bed has around $420 in linens on it, this is why we ask for a deposit.  Typically the only damage we've had is smoke and linens.

The unit smells pleasant and you will sleep on high quality, freshly laundered linens.  

We all love to read and take books with us on vacation.  Sometimes we wing it, just start driving and book from the road with a last-minute hotel app.  Sometimes we plan a year in advance.

I'm a Super Host because I love hosting!  I am so into creating a great experience for people, I am looking forward to each and every guest.  I'm very friendly and talkative, however, I intend to disappear so guests can create their own memories.

One of my many mottos:  Eat dessert first.

I am a Chicago native and love this city. I love the diversity of the neighborhoods, the history and that there is always something to do.
I'm an avid reader and always have two book going, one fiction, one non-fiction-depending on my mood.
I am currently involved in a torrid affair with my Netflix account but pull myself away to go for a nice walk around the neighborhood or to a local restaurant. My goal this year is to try every Chinese restaurant within a 3 mile radius-there are a lot!
I'm an accountant but currently taking a break for family. I actually kinda miss doing taxes believe it or not. I'm the kind of person that needs to have a project or to be striving towards a goal in order to be at my best so I always have something going on, even small projects bring me peace.
I love trying new restaurants and I also love to cook. Making up my own recipes with whatever random items I have in my fridge is always fun. It usually turns out pretty good too!

We met while working abroad & recently relocated to Chicago to be closer to family & enjoy this fantastic city.

In 2016 we bought this 130+ year old historic greystone home.  We spent 18 months meticulously taking it apart one wooden beam at a time. After overhauling the heating, plumbing, & electric with the most efficient systems we could find, we then put it all back together - preserving as much of the original hardwood, bricks & beautiful finishes we possibly could. We found there is indeed truth to the phrase 'labor of love', and we couldn't be more proud of the work we've accomplished.  

Our professional careers revolve around sustainability & we try to lead our lives as close to our environmentally friendly values as we can while still leading modern, robust lives. We love spending as much outdoors time as the weather allows us;  hiking, gardening, skiing - we love it all.

Happy people are awesome!!  -If you need an odd hour early check-in,  late check-out or luggage storage, I am flexible with times but let's discuss before completing reservation and there will be a $25 dollar charge to your reservation for early check -in this includes luggage storage. Your room may still be in use by previous guest and I need time to make it clean and ready for you so early check-in is not always available! IF YOU CHECK OUT LATE AND ITS NOT PREARRANGED at least 24 hrs before check-out,  YOU WILL BE CHARGED $25 every 15 minutes past CHECK OUT TIME, this charge starts 1 minute after the check out time and this is not a joke, holding up cleaning the room for another guest or for whatever reason I desire, is quite rude and I expect that you leave at the scheduled time.

I have both an undergrad and  graduate degree from the College of Nursing at UIC.  I work in a local Healthcare Center.
I am fluent in Spanish. Chicago Native. 
I enjoy Bikram yoga, jogging, photography, traveling, art walks, and I am a complete MUSIC NERD, listening to records, love live music, will travel long distance even out of country for a show or favorite musician..... 

Before the airbnb era, I often house swapped, couch surfed, traded room& board for a service, used other popular websites to find room rentals, etc! 

Favorite quote “What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?”
― Vincent van Gogh

I have traveled extensively, having been to several countries outside of North America, I most often prefer the comfort of a home when away, rather than a posh hotel. For both economical and sustainable reasons, most of these travels have been on a budget, in which I prefer to defer the big tourist hot spots, and spend my money in local communities.  Live like a local is our travel motto!!

So far I have hosted a very diverse array of guests: medical & nursing students, people here for internships, work projects, railroad engineers, vacationers, last minute get-away trips, road trip pit stops, stranded at the airport, music festival junkies, the list goes on, feel free to add yourself to the list!!  Our longest airbnb reservation was for an international graduate student  who stayed 8 months as she awaited her work visa to be approved,  while working as an accountant at a manufacturing company a few miles away from our home. Our shortest airbnb reservations are one nighters who sometimes just want a few hours of sleep or rest while stranded or waiting on a flight from midway airport, but even o'hare airport has provided us some lovely guest as well!

Just north of Downtown Chicago, the hip, tree-lined, brick building-filled Uptown neighborhood is where you go if you want a break from the craziness of the city.

If you’ll be heading Downtown during your stay, you’re only a 10-minute walk from the Wilson CTA station, which will get you into the city in 30 minutes. You’ll find cozy coffee shops, trendy restaurants, and even a Walgreens nearby. Need a little caffeine boost to start your Windy City morning? Everybody’s Coffee is a cheery neighborhood coffeehouse known for their sustainable crop-to-cup creations, tasty pastries, and staff smiles - and it’s just a 5-minute walk from our place.

Unless you like paying for overpriced parking garages! Wilson CTA train station is a nice 10-minute walk from our place.

Or give your friends back home a serious case of FOMO by sharing some scenic Windy City shots. Limited street parking is available, but not reliable, so we don’t recommend renting a car. However, Uber and Lyft are always an option for those looking to ride in style and venture a little further around town.","Condo Access is through the front entrance or side door entrances.
