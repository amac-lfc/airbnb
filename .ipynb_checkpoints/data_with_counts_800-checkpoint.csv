This is Joe, Alex, and sometimes Rob.  If you stay here we will be your hosts while here in Chicago.

Please read through our entire ad and offering before asking questions or requesting a stay.  If after that you still have questions feel free to ask.  If you dont and just want to book after reading, I'm positive we will deliver a great stay.

We also often cook for guests and like filling the cookie jar with delicious baked goods throughout the month.  

We have been hosting here for 8 years and absolutely love it.    This is our full time profession but we also dabble in mystery shopping as well as online sales and stained glass.

My name is William.

I am a self-employed artist living & directing a gallery in Wicker Park. Last year I completed a Masters degree in Fine Arts at the School Of The Art Institute of Chicago where I studied Video, Performance, Photography and Film.

Important things to me are dream recording, writing, correspondence art, experimental film, movement practices, reading & traveling. I try to travel as often as possible, even if it's just a driving trip of two hours to camp somewhere for a night or two.

I want to provide an environment for artists & other creative, passionate individuals to have a voice & present their work. Sharing stories, ideas, experiences & realities are what we're in it for. We at the gallery are holding the torch in the neighborhood to provide a space for what might be unsayable elsewhere. We are daily developing our intentional space here to create an inspiring atmosphere for all who step foot inside, whether it's for a project proposal or a short visit. It's an older building, lovingly-worn, rooms with character surrounding an open gallery space.

As an airbnb guest, you can expect that we'll be curious about you. Our roommates & us all get along really well: It is an easy going dynamic here at the house. We are an eclectic variety!

Southward, (towards 95th and Damen) 2 stops, it goes right to the Green Line train, at the California station.  Northward (toward Kedzie) 2 stops, it connects to CTA Bus Route 66 Chicago Ave bus and the 52 North California bus route. Very easy.  Uber and Lyft both come here happily, and I have a good relationship with the drivers that I get often.  There is a bike rental (Divvy) right by the California train stop, and one a block north of me at a green center. I have my own bike so I haven't used Divvy, but there are racks all over the city to rent it or return it. You can also take a bike on the bus, loaded on the front rack, or on the train if it is not rush hour.","First of all, Welcome! Feel free to use the living room in front of the bedroom.

I do much of my work at home;  in my studio.
 I spend as much time out on the porch as possible, doing writing and some stitching, tending flowers and a veggie garden out in the surrounding yards. I have my own little happy zone right here in the middle of a major metropolitan city, including friendly neighbors.
My little rat terrier Mayzee is my constant companion. 
Things I like to do...  Indie Films usually turn out to be my faves.  I go to some live theater, as well as help make it here in town. Books, got to have books always. And Bike Riding!.  I probably would love yoga if I would think to do it more Ha! 
Veggie food for me, sometimes I like to cook. Former foodie, did my time in the restaurant biz. 
If you would stay over here with me, you are welcome to make yourself at home.  Have your privacy or hang out, I leave it to you. My dog may like to have a cuddle, if you are up for that. You might want to hang by the electric fireplace heh, very mod, and toasty. I have lots of books to peruse for such an evening.
I know in traveling I look for the food of the people! I can tell you my spots or help you find what you might be looking for. Or bring take out, eat in the living room, or back porch if you like al fresco. 
But maybe you just want to  crash someplace tidy and less sterile than a hotel, that's cool. The building is old, maybe a hundred years? but it has all new plumbing and such, so I feel it is the best of both worlds. 
I don't know that I have a life motto, but I firmly believe in doing what makes me happy!
I look forward to meeting interesting people on their travels; feeds the brain!

Please read through our entire ad and offering before asking questions or requesting a stay.  If after that you still have questions feel free to ask.  If you dont and just want to book after reading, I'm positive we will deliver a great stay.

We also often cook for guests and like filling the cookie jar with delicious baked goods throughout the month.  

We have been hosting here for 8 years and absolutely love it.    This is our full time profession but we also dabble in mystery shopping as well as online sales and stained glass.

We're Divvytrekkers, proud members of the Airbnb community and DivvyTrek (follow us on (Hidden by Airbnb) ), which is at the intersection of travel and real estate, committed to balanced and healthy living—mind, body and soul.  

We love to see the world and interact with interesting people from everywhere given that travel is our passion, having savored the rich aroma of stew in Ilorin, Nigeria.  Taken in the sunset with St. Lucia's Piton Mountains in the background. Climbed the steps of a Mayan Temple in Central America. Feasted on freshly caught lobster along Maine's southern coast.  Gazed upon the faraway valleys high up in the Andes from the heights of Manchu Picchu. 

These are only a few of the amazing places we've enjoyed together. 

We also take delight in great music and experiencing cuisines from around the world, in addition to hosting.  Of course, providing a unique guest experience takes a lot of work. For this reason, we have the help of DivvyTrek's Valorwings app which makes hosting fun and easy.  With Valorwings we believe it's possible that everyone can be a host.  

By the way, we highly recommend downloading Acehopper, the “front desk concierge"" app, to explore the area. Available for iPhone, iPad and Android devices, Acehopper has tickets, guides and tips on must-see places to visit. 

While our exciting careers keep us highly engaged and quite busy, we always find time to enjoy life and share experiences with the amazing people who choose to stay with us when we're at home. 

Thus far, we've had the privilege of hosting guests from Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and from all over the United States.  The list keeps growing!

Bio from a few years ago :) ""My name is Rebecca, and I will be living in Buenos Aires starting mid November. I am enrolled in an English teaching certification course and will be teaching full time after completing the course. I love Spanish and hope to use it frequently while living here. I lived in Granada, Spain for five months a few years ago (I will have to get a hang of the differences in Spanish and have been reading about it!) I fell in love with traveling and am so excited to learn about the culture of Buenos Aires and those who live here. I enjoy meeting new people and am a very open minded, passionate person. I believe that seeing the world can open one's eyes, and I am grateful to have this experience to do so. I cannot wait to soak in the city of Buenos Aires and see many other cities in South America. My plans regarding housing are tentative, so this is a great resource I would love to use!""",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/23351061/profile_pic/1415576719/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/23351061/profile_pic/1415576719/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Old Town,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",t,f,"Chicago, IL, United States",Old Town,Lincoln Park,,Chicago,IL,60614,Chicago,"Chicago, IL",US,United States,41.912,-87.64307,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,6,1.0,2.0,2.0,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Free street parking"",Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox,""Private living room"",""Private entrance"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Single level home"",""Long term stays allowed""}",,$180.00,,,,$50.00,2,$10.00,2,10,2,2,10,10,2.0,10.0,7 weeks ago,t,8,8,8,8,2020-04-23,49,49,2019-06-28,2020-03-12,99.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,t,City registration pending,"{""Illinois State"","" Cook County"","" IL"","" CHICAGO""}",t,f,strict_14_with_grace_period,f,f,2,2,0,0,4.88,4.0,6.78

This train is one of the essential ones in Chicago, allowing you to reach downtown in less than 20 minutes! Also near the 8 bus (also headed downtown) and the 152 (headed west on Addison). You are also just a few blocks away from the water's edge if you want a great view of the lake :-) I recommend traveling exclusively via CTA here, just because parking can be tricky when so close to Wrigley Field. It's cheap, and so close-by. There are also taxis everywhere, and you usually don't have to wait more than 5 minutes for an Uber or Lyft driver. It's a very popular area, so it's a breeze getting to and from here.","You are allowed access to the entire house, save my private room.

This is a place where anything can be happening at any time of year and I love being a part of it!
I'm a huge fan of music, especially classic rock and vocal music. I'm a singer, so I love to listen to music that I can recreate myself. If you love making/experiencing music, I think we'll get along fine.
Theater and acting is my main passion, and I enjoy watching it as much as doing it. Thank the Lord for Netflix! But nothing compares to watching live theater, and Chicago has some of the best.

If you like your privacy, I can fully appreciate that, but just say the word and I can also be good company. There may even be breakfast/a cold drink involved. Your choice, I'm happy to provide.

This was a booming entertainment district for shopping and revelry in the 1920s and 1930s — though the area has weathered multiple changes over time. Most recently, a renaissance has been underway in the Uptown neighborhood and that faded glory is sparkling once again in the form of restored movie palaces and Art Deco beauties. For live music and nightlife, sit back for some jazz at the Green Mill, a 100-year-old classic where the swanky atmosphere harks back to prohibition's heyday. Or for a lively mix, go for either indie rock, salsa concerts at the Riviera or Aragon.","Thor and Sasha, our 2 friendly low maintenance cats are here to welcome and be your friend!","Street parking is plentiful and free on Magnolia Ave.  If needed, we have a secure parking lot behind our condo for your use.

Only about half a square mile, Ukrainian Village manages to serve as a shopping hub, hipster haven, cozy neighborhood for the stroller set, and, yes, outpost for immigrants from Ukraine. As you wander along Chicago Avenue, you’ll see storefront signs in Ukrainian, no English in sight, even though the original population has dwindled to a couple of thousand from its one-time high of around 30,000. Indeed, the rest of the city has discovered the well-maintained housing stock and double-wide sidewalks of Division Street—welcoming features that in 1983 prompted Mayor Jane Byrne to designate Ukrainian Village an official neighborhood, the first in Chicago.","Please note that there are tenants that live in the same building.

I recently acquired a job with a digital marketing agency where I spend my time making websites, brand strategies, and creating content such as photos and blog articles for clients!  Let me know if you have an interest in any of the above!

I graduated from Northwestern University in 2013 and never left the city of Chicago because I had a desire to explore and learn and build my creative career here. Chicago is an absolutely wonderful place to live and grow.

I put together MaiTri Chicago in early 2017 because I wanted a space where people can teach others and learn and connect from other people who are like minded, mindful, and creative people. MaiTri is a community full of artists and healers. We co-create workshops, yoga classes, and politically mindful artist showcases to the mindful community. 

The desire to connect and give others a way to connect never went away since my study abroad experiences in London and Prague and my work experience with the creative artists here in Chicago. I enjoy it more than ever and I frequently travel overseas to major world cities to open my mind and have new experiences .... ~ I love what we do .

It has become a magnet for sports fans and young professionals alike, and particularly singles who hop from bar to bar along Clark, Addison and Sheffield Avenues. Rather tame by day, the neighborhood's souvenir shops and casual eateries are open but quiet. For late night entertainment, a boisterous after-hours crowd heads to Wrigleyville for everything from live music to sketch comedy. But if there's a day game or a night game letting out at ""The Friendly Confines"" then look out: the streets swell with the masses of fans looking to celebrate a Cubs win... or lament their lovable losers.","There is one spot included.

I am a world traveler. I am also a writer, photographer, TV producer, & video consultant. I recently traveled for 2 1/2 years solo around the world. It was amazing. I've now been to 61 countries. 

I work from home...or wherever I am in the world. :)
I love food of all kinds, animals, and laughter. 
I am organized, neat and clean and like to meet interesting people and learn new things. I also like my quiet, alone time.

Relax in the massive custom steam shower or catch up on HBO on the 50” WiFi TV. Luxurious details throughout -premium espresso, memory foam beds and upgraded linens, fully-equipped kitchen. BOTH bedrooms have private baths, huge walk-in closets, and easy reach USB outlets. Super central location- Quick walk to Blue Line Train (DIRECT to ORD) - Ten minutes to Downtown, Wicker Park, and Lincoln Park. We have tried to attend to every detail- I love boutique hotels and I wanted our Airbnb to reflect that experience. This is a two-bedroom, two-bath private apartment and the garden level of our historic greystone, a classic Chicago property type.

Four blocks to Blue Line- This cozy garden retreat is a half block to the neighborhood’s famous Logan Boulevard, lined with park space and historic mansions. Steps to coffee and cocktails, Logan Square is a diner’s paradise. Walk to Fat Rice, Lost Lake, Longman and Eagle and Lula. You’re also an easy eight minute walk to the Logan Square Blue Line. Easy street parking.","This is the garden (ground) level of a two-flat- You will hear occasional footsteps above but residents are respectful and polite- they are two professional women and not early risers! Based on my personal spent time in the unit, this will not impact your experience in a significant way. Although we have honored historic details wherever possible, this is a brand new apartment with great insulation. We offer a white noise machine just in case. Ceilings are over 7 ft and while not soaring, tall guests have been comfortable. The unit has radiant in-floor heating (no cold feet!) controlled in your unit with a traditional thermostat. Because it is an English garden and partially below grade, the temperature is very stable. We have window air conditioners for summer.",Logan Square is extremely central. We are a four block walk to Blue Line Train (which connects directly to ORD/O’Hare Airport!) and joins all trains with a 15 minute ride South toward the Loop.  The Blue Line runs underground and does not share tracks- it is by far the fastest city train line.  This neighborhood is particularly easy for cabs as you are only 2 minutes from the 90/94 Expressway:       - 10 minutes to Wicker Park      - 10 minutes to Lincoln Park      - 8 min to West Loop/Fulton Market       -15/20 min to Magnificent Mile/Wrigley,You're welcome to enjoy the backyard (we have great neighbors). Trash / recycling through gate behind yard. Shared free laundry.,"I'll meet you at check-in if possible and make some recommendations.

Piles of dirty dishes will be charged a $50 additional cleaning fee. Please text Kristin if there are any dishwasher questions.   - Do not worry about used sheets and towels - we will handle.  However, if you stain the sheets and towels with make-up, blood, etc... you will be charged for the price of the item. Please simply rinse off stains if they accidentally get on our linens.  This is an easy step that will help me enormously. We also have OxyClean in our laundry room. -Please no smoking inside.

Our boys love it- it's fantastic for a quiet retreat, or play time with the kiddos. There's a great free parking lot also.  2. Enjoy Humboldt Park- it's within walking distance or hop on the bus/car.

It's also not difficult to drive to a train stop and park nearby. Uber and Lyft are also easy and affordable options.

If you want to go out for some cocktails, we have our local dive bar a block away, or trendy bars within walking distance. If you want good food, some of Chicago's best restaurants are in the area.  If you want one of America's best burgers, head over to Kuma's Corner. If you want good pizza, we have a Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Pequads Pizza, D'agostinos, and many more because we are Chicago.  If you want to try a native Chicago Italian Beef, we are down the street from Al's Beef, here you can also find a delicious Chicago Style Hot Dog, and you won't be disappointed.

You can also take the bus down the brown line if you so wish, that would connect to red line as well.  Bus – The Diversey bus picks up at the end of the block at Rockwell and Campbell streets, and we are in between both of those streets. The Western Bus picks up at the corner of George and Western or Diversey and Western which is a 3 minute walk.  Divvy Bikes – Pick up a city bike from the bike station and you pay as you go.  You can pick them up all around the area, but I think the closest one is at the corner of Elston and Logan Square Boulevard Car – Free Street parking is right around the corner, and spots are always available.

Our building is just a short walk from the Belmont “L” train station. Search for “Belmont red line station” in Maps, click the “Directions” button, then enter your point of interest. 2. “Is there parking nearby?” Parking in Chicago is always difficult and even more so in the evening and during special events.

We're a short walk from the Belmont 'L' train station. Search for “Belmont Red Line station Chicago” in Maps, click the “Directions” button, then enter your point of interest. 2. “Is there parking nearby?” Parking in Chicago is often difficult and even more so in the evening and during special events. We recommend using a service called SpotHero because it allows you to reserve a nearby paid parking spot in advance so that you don’t have to worry about finding parking when you arrive. 3. When is check-in/check-out? Check-in is 3 p.m. or later but you're welcome to stop by anytime after 11:30 a.m. to drop off your bags in the living room. Check-out is at 11 a.m. Our cleaning staff will need access to the apartment at 11 a.m., but you’re welcome to leave your bags in the living room and pick them up","Because of our central location, we recommend leaving your car at home.

I love the “Last Week Tonight” and I secretly still aspire to host my own talk show. I love NPR, The Young Turks, and reading books on my iPad/iPhone.

I love our city apartment- it allows me to moderate my bazillion hobbies from beer brewing on the back porch 5 gallons at a time to keeping a vertical herb garden with a shoe organizer. It's kind of like cooking, but with baby potatoes you know? Plus, it's an excellent excuse to have a cigar collection... because they're small.

I'm a collection of different things- in high school I was on the football team, but also a band geek.

I still could eat pizza for every meal and continuously watch Arrested Development on a loop if you let me.

WE ARE LOCATED IN A LARGE CITY. PARKING IS DIFFICULT. Public transit is a much better option. Buses and trains are literally ride outside my front door and about a minute walk from the apartment (train ride downtown is then only a 10 minute ride) Cabs: No more than a moments wait to flag a cab directly out front of my place day and night. This is a safe area where you can walk around at night as well. Parking: We are about 5 minutes from downtown so Parking is limited, random and mostly based on luck like any populated urban area. research the neighborhood and plan ahead. I do not provide parking and due to the popularity of the area my recommendations will only go so far. Our location is great for public transit, which we recommend you use. Here are some tips:  (Website hidden by Airbnb)  Or reserve your spot with Spot Hero:","We have a shared lounge, bathroom and table space available to guests. The upstairs is my personal apartment.","I try to give my guests as much space as I think they want or need. If I am around, I am accessible but not in your space, meaning I am working in my office with the door slightly cracked or doing something upstairs while you are downstairs in your bedroom or bathroom. I also operate a recording studio so sometimes I am upstairs recording stuff. I also have two friendly dogs who generally hang with me in the office. They sometimes bark when people arrive but are super friendly after a couple minutes. They do not have access to the basement. On the other hand, if you need answers or just want to talk, I always enjoy this part of the host experience.

Uptown is slightly north of Downtown, and just a mile west of Montrose Beach and Lake Shore Drive. It’s safe, a little historic, a little trendy, and a perfect home base for any Chi-Town getaway. Our apartment is within walking distance of coffee shops (including a Starbucks), banks, and grocery stores. This hip neighborhood features old-school Chicago gems like the famed Riviera Theatre, the much-loved Fat Cat Restaurant & Bar, and easy access to Wrigley Field and Downtown via the Red Line from Lawrence Station. With plenty of good restaurants, vibrant bars, and exciting venues, you might find yourself not even wanting to venture downtown! Some of our favorite nearby restaurants include Fat Cat, where you can indulge in tasty pub grub over a game of pool, and Demera, an Ethiopian restaurant serving top-notch coffee shareable s","***WIFI service is an open connection  provided by the building management and is in the works of upgrading it. Outages may be experienced from time to time while the upgrade is on going. As of this moment, the service is NOT SUITABLE for remote work and can only cater mobile/portable devices. We highly recommend keeping your key fob in a safe place, because if you lose it, you’ll lose access to the entire building. Not fun. It takes time to replace it, which means you might be locked out of the building and the apartment for a while, and any fob replacement will incur a fee of $300. That’s probably not what you have in mind for a “memorable” trip to Chicago, so let’s just keep track of the fob. Our apartment includes lots of awesome amenities, but it does NOT include a parking space. If you need to park a vehicle, there is some metered street parking nearby. We recommend using the Spot Hero app to claim a street parking space. The city is easily accessible with public transit and ride","Unless you’re really into parallel parking or overpriced meters, we recommend using public transportation to explore Chi-town. Our place is just a 5-minute walk to both the Argyle and Lawrence stations, where you can catch the Red Line. The Red Line will take you straight to Wrigley Field (7 minutes), or keep on riding for about 15 more minutes to access the best of Downtown. Grant/State Station is most convenient to the tasty restaurants of River North, and Lake Station puts you just 3 blocks from the Bean. P.S. Locals call the subway the “L.” Public transit is also an easy way to get to our place from O’Hare Airport, especially during rush hour. Hop on the Blue Line at the airport, and switch to the #51 bus at the Jefferson Park Transit Center. You’ll go from baggage claim to beautiful condo in only an hour! If ridesharing is more your style, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro.

There you will find pictures of the neighborhood, Humboldt Park. During the day it's lovely to walk around but at night it's a quiet residential strip of 12 houses.  It's located 6 miles (9km) from downtown.","PLEASE READ CAREFULLY A lot of guests book without noting where they are booking because of the price. However we are located on a quiet Boulevard of only 11 houses. At night there is no night life on the street. Some guests have reported that upon taking taxis or Uber, the drivers have suggested that this is not a safe area. That however is not true. We have lived in this Boulevard for over 13 years and never have had any bad experiences. We encourage you to take a walk up Division Street and experience for yourself this wonderful neighborhood and all that it has to offer. Little by little Humboldt Park is changing it's reputation and we are proud to be part of it.  As proof that you have read this, when writing please start out with the word ""Pancho"". IMPORTANT: You can hear the walking from upstairs, when people shower or move stuff across the floor. Some guests aren't picky about this but others are so please be aware.","The CTA bus stop, both for bus #65 that drops you off right in front of Navy Pier and bus #66 that drops you off right on the Magnificent Mile, are only half a block away. Now there are bike stations all around the town. Only a block away you will find a bike station, which is an excellent option if you want to bike to downtown. It's about $10 for the whole day and you have to return the bike every half hour at the nearest station. The bus on Grand Avenue or Chicago Avenue take you in 15 minutes to the Blue line stop which you can also use to get around.","There is a public pool just half a block away open during the summer. If you love to relax, the house is located right on Humboldt Park so you can go for a jog, a walk or a picnic.","Nancy, my mother, is the one who will greet you and help you throughout your stay. She works during the day but in the evenings is more than willing to help you out with whatever you need. She knows how Airbnb works and is eager to host you! ;-) Hablamos Español también!","**Please note the location. A lot of guests book because of the price and do not look at the location to then check-out and leave a 1 star location review, which of course makes us sad because we can't pick up our house and move it to downtown.  **We don't have CableTV, only a smartTV with Netflix, YouTube, etc. 1. Please do let us know your approx. check-in and check-out times this way we can coordinate our cleaning schedule. 2. The floors above the basement are more than 100 years old so while we definitely want to replace them so they don't squeak so much, it's not something we can afford right now. Therefore, YES you can hear the walking and the other airbnb guests from the floor above. Sometimes it may be quiet but sometimes if they arrive late, you will clearly hear the foot steps on the wood.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read a bit about myself. I will start out by saying that to me there's nothing like a good conversation. I love talking about geography, different cultures and even finances. 

My true passion is hosting. I would love to dedicate to it full time sooner rather than later. After having studied abroad for 3 years, more than taking myself around the world, I want to show Puerto Rico and Chicago to the world. If you're curious, I was born and raised in paradise: Puerto Rico!

I know how much guests value when a host personally welcomes them, however due to work and being between Puerto Rico and Chicago, unfortunately I'm not available to greet each guest personally. Regardless, I can guarantee that all my places will make you feel like at home. I have put a lot of effort and love into getting them setup. Each one of our listings (""our"" because my mom is the big helper) has been available for hosting after both my mom and I have stayed at each one and have approved them. We will say we are quite into the details; if you are too, I'm sure you'll notice.  

About me, I can't live without traveling, those deep conversations that by the end have made you question yourself and of course I most definitely can't live without Pancho! Pancho is my son (well, my dog) whom I just spoil too much. I rescued him from the streets of Puerto Rico and ever since we have been partners in crime. 

FOOD! Almost forgot about that one. Can't live without it! I love trying new dishes so if I'm around and you feel like cooking and exchanging recipes, let's do it! 

I love hosting guests that have positive vibes, are relaxed and know how to make the most out of every moment.

My favorite two board games are Mancala and Rummikub so if you think you can take a challenge, I'm more than willing to play! ;-)

Welcome to your temporary home in Chicago!  We love our location near Hyde Park, the University of Chicago, the Lake and the Parks and just over 10 minutes to downtown Chicago via the Lake.  

Our family of four takes full advantage of the walking and bike trails in the area. We also frequent nearby Hyde Park, for its distinctive and unique offerings and to hopefully, run into a friend or two.

We still love road trips but, our favorite trips are with our extended family.  Recently, 20+ family members descended upon San Pedro, Belize and again in Costa Rica.  This year less exotic Washington, DC is on the list.

Because I have Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis I am an licensed Illinois Medical Cannabis patient.  I live a healthy lifestyle which includes living gluten-free and I encourage others to incorporate health into their lives.

The Spark Clubs is based on a wellness concept.   We do not allow tobacco because it is a known carcinogen and the chemicals affect the air quality of everyone in the building.  The smoke smell lays on the walls and soft goods, linens and curtains.  We have to spend extra money to clean that off when folks violate our rules. That is why we have a security deposit now to encourage good behavior.

When people use cannabis alone, there tends to be significantly less smell and it does not linger. With the ventilation methods we employ, any smoke can be quickly evacuated from the room.  As a result, our rooms stay fresh.  

As far as linens are concerned, we shopped for high-quality bedding to provide you with the best sleep experience you can find.  Our beds have toppers and pads and down comforters and feather pillows and percale sheets... all designed to make your sleep experience exceptional.  In order to maintain our investment in our linens, we ask that people refrain from smoking, eating or drinking in the bedrooms.  Each bed has around $420 in linens on it, this is why we ask for a deposit.  Typically the only damage we've had is smoke and linens.

The unit smells pleasant and you will sleep on high quality, freshly laundered linens.  

We all love to read and take books with us on vacation.  Sometimes we wing it, just start driving and book from the road with a last-minute hotel app.  Sometimes we plan a year in advance.

I'm a Super Host because I love hosting!  I am so into creating a great experience for people, I am looking forward to each and every guest.  I'm very friendly and talkative, however, I intend to disappear so guests can create their own memories.

One of my many mottos:  Eat dessert first.

My name is Lesly! I’m 29 years old and live with my fiancé, Shane, and our very friendly dog, Bradley (named after Bradley University where Shane and I both attended undergrad). I work as a school psychologist at an elementary school, and Shane works as a clinical researcher.

Shane and I grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, but both moved into the city just as soon as we could. I think Shane has lived in just about every Chicago neighborhood there is (from Pilsen to the South Loop to Wicker Park...)!  In the end we settled in our home in Logan Square. We love the atmosphere of this neighborhood! The people are incredibly warm and friendly, there is always something to do, like going to the farmer’s market on Sundays or checking out a concert in the square, and we can’t forget about the FOOD! Shane and I are both foodies. We love trying new restaurants. I also love to cook and he loves using his smoker and grill in the summer.

I see myself as part of the solution. I love it here because it is not crowded, and it is so close to downtown. I walk around at night, but I am sensible about it. The train station is crummy looking, let's admit it. Don't judge me or my street by that! most train stations are a little run down. My area is adjacent to so much. Garfield Park Conservatory is near, United Center, Humboldt Park, Ukrainian Village are about a mile or so away. There are great spots to eat all along Chicago Avenue, California and Division both have lots of neighborhood eateries and bars, funky boutiques. Logan Square is a short ride away, with all it's hot spots. And of course access to downtown with all it's high end shopping, attractions, and the Lake! is just east of me easily accessible by train. Save your parking m","Our neighborhood is on the edge of what used to be an industrial corridor, now transitioning to being used for artsy offices and band practice lofts, breweries and artsy places to have weddings and such. Houses up and down the street are being cleaned up fixed up daily. Whereas it is not a POSH upscale neighborhood, a new private school across the street a couple years ago gave the whole area an upswing, but we can still park free!","CTA Route 94 South California stops at the front door.  To the south 2 stops, it goes right to the Green Line train, at the California station.  To the north 2 stops, it connects to Route 66 Chicago Ave bus and the 52 North California bus route. Very easy.  Uber and Lyft both come here happily, and I have a good relationship with the drivers that I get often.  There is a bike rental (Divvy) right by the California train stop, and a block north of me at a green center. I have my own bike so I haven't used Divvy, but there are racks all over the city to rent it or return it. You can also take a bike on the bus, loaded on the front rack, or on the train if it is not rush hour.","First of all, Welcome! Feel free to use the living room. Coffee or tea anytime, self serve.

I do much of my work at home;  in my studio.
 I spend as much time out on the porch as possible, doing writing and some stitching, tending flowers and a veggie garden out in the surrounding yards. I have my own little happy zone right here in the middle of a major metropolitan city, including friendly neighbors.
My little rat terrier Mayzee is my constant companion. 
Things I like to do...  Indie Films usually turn out to be my faves.  I go to some live theater, as well as help make it here in town. Books, got to have books always. And Bike Riding!.  I probably would love yoga if I would think to do it more Ha! 
Veggie food for me, sometimes I like to cook. Former foodie, did my time in the restaurant biz. 
If you would stay over here with me, you are welcome to make yourself at home.  Have your privacy or hang out, I leave it to you. My dog may like to have a cuddle, if you are up for that. You might want to hang by the electric fireplace heh, very mod, and toasty. I have lots of books to peruse for such an evening.
I know in traveling I look for the food of the people! I can tell you my spots or help you find what you might be looking for. Or bring take out, eat in the living room, or back porch if you like al fresco. 
But maybe you just want to  crash someplace tidy and less sterile than a hotel, that's cool. The building is old, maybe a hundred years? but it has all new plumbing and such, so I feel it is the best of both worlds. 
I don't know that I have a life motto, but I firmly believe in doing what makes me happy!
I look forward to meeting interesting people on their travels; feeds the brain!

These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for unparalleled boutique shopping, esoteric book stores and their countless art galleries — many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails and an affinity for independent clothing designers, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country. The area has recently become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated dining scene, boasting some of city's most sought after restaurants, including Takashi and Big Star. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force Violet Hour.

We all spend a lot of time outside the house, but when I'm home, I love to cook dinner, snacks, or cookies for guests.

Outages may be experienced from time to time while the upgrade is on going. As of this moment, the service is NOT SUITABLE for remote work and can only cater mobile/portable devices.

I've been in  hospitality for almost 20 years, and love every day of it. It would be my pleasure to be your hostess.

I am a Realtor in Illinois,  so if you are transitioning to Chicago, I will be your home-finding expert! Apartment, condo, townhome, 1-4 unit building, or single family home. We can find you the perfect place to call home! Moving out of state? Let me find a Realtor professional to help you. 

I am a Superhost with Airbnb, and I dedicate myself to making your stay wonderful. I decided to become an Airbnb hostess because I feel Chicago is such a beautiful city, but it's shame that hotels are so expensive. Since lodging is the weight of most trips' cost, this is a wonderful way to help each other. I am a Chicago native, born and raised, and know the city very well.

The atmosphere of my home is peaceful, pleasant, and fun.  I enjoy music, film, sight-seeing, dining, travel, photography, yoga, and nature. Help yourself to the coffee bar bananas & OJ.  You are more than welcome to bring and store your own food for extended stay. I have mini fridges in the rooms for you to use & store your food. 

A sweet cat lives in unit--16 yrs young! He's very friendly , but if you're allergic to pets, please be aware. I Do Not allow other pets to join you, I apologize in advance. I also Do Not allow other guests without prior approval on the reservation. 

I have some ground rules for my BnB home: BE courteous, BE friendly, BE honest, BE open. If you have ANY questions or concerns, feel free to ask any time. BE Yourself:) I am a very reasonable, down-to-earth person. I'm here to help you have a wonderful trip! Keep your space clean, free from food, and excess garbage. Keep all common spaces free of your items.

I also have a NO DRUGS,  NO SMOKING inside policy, as my Landlord is a police officer, and is on premises most days.  I do not allow any unregistered guest into my Home, at ANY time. If they are not verified through Airbnb & not on your reservation I cannot allow them into my home. This protects everyone. 

I can offer bag drop case-by-case. Please message me with any questions. 

I look forward to hosting your stay! Reach out wirh any questions!

Having spent more time than I care to remember in sterile, uninviting hotel rooms, I was initially attracted to vacation rentals as refreshing, and often more affordable, alternatives.  What I found were the same white walls and beige furniture or, even worse, cluttered rooms and Aunt Edna's donated dilapidated couch in the living room.  Well, welcome to something different.  Take a break from your busy schedule by relaxing in clean, inviting rental that that feels enough like home that you're immediately comfortable while being so special you'll look forward to your return.  Many of my guests have been back 2 or 3 times, and some have found themselves venturing across the country to check out another Red Hot Vacation Rental.  

My places are located in Chicago, Miami Beach and San Francisco. I've lived in all 3 cities and am happy to suggest hidden local gems or recommend the best nearby dry cleaner.

and has long been a leading financial institution in Chicago, Illinois.

When the stock market crashed in 1929, sparking the Great Depression, it was Ethan Winterberg’s firm belief in personal client service, financial conservatism, and business acumen that allowed J&W L.V.R to survive the crash. To this day, these tenets remain etched into J&W L.V.R’s foundation and serve as the pillars of our business. 

Over the years, as many competing firms went out of business, the Winterbergs made many decisions with an eye towards improving client service and firm stability. These included utilizing specialized clearing firms for improved account service and safety, closing the futures brokerage division, and spinning off the trading operation. 

Today, we have expanded to include such ventures as Airbnb, starting with our first unit located a couple of blocks away for the magnificent mile, and the lake front.

Feel positive. Live positive.  I grew up in a small coastal town in Maine.  When I turned 19 I realized that I was a closet wanderer.  So I hit the road and covered much of the U.S. and all of Europe.  I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.  I'm rooted in one of the coolest communities I know.  Rich with art and spirit. I have two amazing girls that help me garden, can, collect eggs and milk.  My partner is a fellow East Coast boy, avid hockey player and my right hand man. I also tour with an ABBA tribute band as well as a Pink Floyd tribute band but don't hold that against me.

We're a short walk from the Belmont 'L' train station. Search for “Belmont Red Line station Chicago” in Maps, click the “Directions” button, then enter your point of interest. 2. “Is there parking nearby?” Parking in Chicago is often difficult and even more so in the evening and during special events. We recommend using a service called SpotHero because it allows you to reserve a nearby paid parking spot in advance so that you don’t have to worry about finding parking when you arrive. 3.

The Montrose bus is two blocks away and a 25 min ride to the beachfront at Lake Michigan or to the Brown Line.  The Lawrence Ave bus is a few blocks north and travels east about a mile to the Brown Line (or all the way to the lakefront, too). Brown Line goes to the Loop and stops a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue as well, with stops along the way at DePaul or Lincoln Park or Old Town. You can transfer to the Red Line from the Brown Line at Belmont or Fullerton and go to the Apple Store Lincoln Park or keep going  and get off at Grand to walk over to North Michigan Avenue or on to State Street and all that provides.

That's my three youngest kids in the scooter sidecar with me. My oldest is all grown up and just graduated from law school in Texas. 
I worked for Apple. I currently consult with companies about technology/internet/social media/marketing/branding. We own the entire building and I work and live (some of the time) on the third floor with tenants on first floor. We use AirBnB for the Garden Apartment (totally private), the second floor is a hostel style AirBnB, and upstairs on the 3rd floor we have up to three bedrooms that are available most days and every other weekend (when my kids are not staying with me).
I enjoy going on bike rides to the beach with my kids, and my girlfriend and her kids. I love to read and I am a tech geek. I am a coffee OR tea drinker and after drinking both black for almost forty years, I have started using cream in them — a habit I picked up in Nairobi, Kenya a couple years ago when I was doing some missionary work (plus my girlfriend uses cream and so I have no choice). 
If I had to pick some things I can't live without: my girlfriend (and her boys); my kids; my technology; my morning coffee; my fellowship; and my friends. And I love to watch movies. Old. New. Comedy. Mystery. Action. It doesn't matter. I like them all. 
I enjoy working out — lifting weights and riding a bike, plus I am a life-long swimmer. I also just started playing hockey! At age 52! Crazy. 
We have been hosting guests for three years now. We have over 141 reviews. We are a SuperHost. We love this. And we are really good at it.
I am a pretty laid back guy. I like things to be neat and tidy, but it's hard to do without motivation. AirBnB has been the motivation to get our place all tricked out and we are very proud of it. We hope you will enjoy staying here. All of our units are in a great neighborhood—in a great city.

Our apartment is within walking distance of coffee shops (including a Starbucks), banks, and grocery stores. More information This hip neighborhood features old-school Chicago gems like the famed Riviera Theatre, the much-loved Fat Cat Restaurant & Bar, and easy access to Wrigley Field and Downtown via the Red Line from Lawrence Station. With plenty of good restaurants, vibrant bars, and exciting venues, you might find yourself not even wanting to venture downtown! Some of our favorite nearby restaurants include Fat Cat, where you can indulge in tasty pub grub over a game of pool, and Demera, an Ethiopian restaurant serving top-notch c","WIFI service is an open connection  provided by the building management and is in the works of upgrading it. Outages may be experienced from time to time while the upgrade is on going. As of this moment, the service is NOT SUITABLE for remote work and can only cater mobile/portable devices. We highly recommend keeping your key fob in a safe place, because if you lose it, you’ll lose access to the entire building. Not fun. It takes time to replace it, which means you might be locked out of the building and the apartment for a while, and any fob replacement will incur a fee of $300. That’s probably not what you have in mind for a “memorable” trip to Chicago, so let’s just keep track of the fob. Our apartment includes lots of awesome amenities, but it does NOT include a parking space. If you need to park a vehicle, there is some metered street parking nearby. We recommend using the Spot Hero app to claim a street parking space. The city is easily accessible with public transit and ridesha","Unless you’re really into parallel parking or overpriced meters, we recommend using public transportation to explore Chi-town. Our place is just a 5-minute walk to both the Argyle and Lawrence stations, where you can catch the Red Line. The Red Line will take you straight to Wrigley Field (7 minutes), or keep on riding for about 15 more minutes to access the best of Downtown. Grant/State Station is most convenient to the tasty restaurants of River North, and Lake Station puts you just 3 blocks from the Bean. P.S. Locals call the subway the “L.” Public transit is also an easy way to get to our place from O’Hare Airport, especially during rush hour. Hop on the Blue Line at the airport, and switch to the #51 bus at the Jefferson Park Transit Center. You’ll go from baggage claim to beautiful condo in only an hour! If ridesharing is more your style, Uber and Lyft are available throughout the Chicago metro. Keep in mind that traffic can pile up Downtown during major events or rush hour, whic","Ever dreamed about jetting off to your own Chicago apartment?
